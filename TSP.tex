\section{Introduction}
The famous Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) states: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? I implemented 3 popular approximation algorithms in an easy to use web-application using JavaScript.


\section{Nearest Neighbor}
The path is decided by which point is closest to the current point, therefore this is a brute-force, greedy algorithm and a naive approach. Despite this, it out performs 2-approximate and Christofides for small sized point sets. No guaranteed approximation. $O(n^2)$ time
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Nearest Neighbor}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Function{NearestNeighbor}{P}
		\State Stack $path$
		\State boolean array $V$ of size $||P||$ populated with false
		\State $path$.push(1)
		\State $i$ = 0
		\While{$||\emph{path}|| < ||\emph{P}||$}
		\State $V_i = true$
		\State $closest =$ closest point to $P_i$
		\State $path$.push(closest)
		\State $i = closest$
		\EndWhile
		\State $path$.push(1)
		\State return $path$
		\EndFunction
		
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{2-Approximate}
Construct path by creating an MST (Prim's was used in my implementation) then performing depth-first search (pre-order traversal). $O(n^2)$ time
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Two Approximate}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Function{Two-Approximate}{P}
		\State Stack $path$
		\State generate complete weighted graph of $P$
		\State $MST =$ minimum spanning tree of weighted graph
		\State adjacency matrix $A$ of size $||P||$ populated with 0
		\For{$i$ in $MST$}
		\State add $i$ to adjacency matrix
		\EndFor
		\State run depth-first-search on $A$ and add each visited node to \State $path$.push(1)
		\State return $path$
		
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Christofides (1.5-Approximate)}
Construct path by creating an MST, find a minimum-cost perfect matching for odd-degree vertices, add edges to MST and form an Eulerian circuit, and then remove all repeated vertices. $O(n^3)$ time
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{1.5 Approximate-}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Function{Christofides}{P}
		\State generate complete weighted graph of $P$
		\State $MST =$ minimum spanning tree of weighted graph
		\State $odd =$ all the odd degree vertices of $MST$
		\State $match =$ minimum weight matching
		\State $E =$ Eulerian circuit using edges of $match$ and $MST$
		\State remove repeated vertices of $E$
		\State return $E$
		
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
