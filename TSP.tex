\section{Introduction}
The famous Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) states: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? I implemented 3 popular approximation algorithms in an easy to use web-application using JavaScript.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Nearest Neighbor}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\State Stack $\emph{path}$
		
		\While{$|\emph{path}| < |\emph{P}|$}
			\State test
		\EndWhile
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Nearest Neighbor}
The path is decided by which point is closest to the current point. No guaranteed approximation. $O(n^2)$ time



\section{2-Approximate}
Construct path by creating an MST (Prim's was used in this example) then performing depth-first search. $O(n^2)$ time

\section{Christofides (1.5-Approximate)}
Construct path by creating an MST, find a minimum-cost perfect matching for odd-degree vertices, add edges to MST and form an Eulerian circuit, and then remove all repeated vertices. $O(n^3)$ time
